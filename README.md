ðŸ“œ Flask + Redis app with Docker, CI/CD and Kubernetes

Description
A small web application built with Flask that tracks visits using Redis.  
This pet project was created to practice and demonstrate DevOps engineering skills, including containerization, CI/CD setup, and Kubernetes deployment.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Flask â€” Python framework for building REST APIs
- Redis â€” key-value store for tracking visits
- Docker, Docker Compose** â€” containerization and local development environment
- nginx â€” reverse proxy server
- Gunicorn â€” production-grade WSGI HTTP server
- GitHub Actions â€” CI/CD: linting, building, and deploying the app
- Kubernetes â€” application deployment in a minimal k8s cluster
- Helm â€” Kubernetes package manager for manifest templating
- Secrets & .env â€” environment variables management

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Strengthen DevOps skills
- Demonstrate the ability to work with modern development and deployment stacks

âœ¨ Features
- Flask application with Redis as a visit counter
- Dockerized environment with Docker Compose
- CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions
- Production-ready build with nginx + Gunicorn
- Makefile and bash scripts for easy local development
- Basic Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment (without Ingress or ConfigMaps for simplicity)

ðŸš€ Future Improvements
- Enhanced Helm chart configurations via `values.yaml`
- Add Ingress controller and ConfigMap usage
- Monitoring setup with Prometheus + Grafana
- Centralized logging with ELK stack or Loki
- Expand app logic (authentication, database integration, Celery tasks)

ðŸ“¦ How to Run Locally
